                    Bill started training Brazilian Jiu Jitsu in Southern California in 1995. He has trained with some of the greatest BJJ fighters and coaches, including Rigan Machado and his brothers, Bob Bass, Pedro Carvalho, Betiiss Mansouri and Rodrigo Teixiera. Bill continues to learn so his students are aware of new developments in BJJ, bringing in techniques from wrestling and other sports. Bill is aware that what works well for him might not be the best for every student, so he presents a variety of approaches and options for each technique. Students develop their own game or style, and Bill’s coaching style is flexible to accommodate each student’s strengths and limitations.

                    While teaching a kids' class about balance, Lisa decided to demonstrate by standing on one foot. A particularly curious 6-year-old asked, "Sensei, are you a flamingo?" Without missing a beat, she started flapping her arms and made flamingo noises, which had all the kids cracking up. Now "flamingo balance" is a regular part of her warm-up routine, and the kids absolutely love it!

                    During a tournament prep session, Jake was explaining a complex submission sequence when his phone started playing his daughter's favorite Disney song at full volume. Instead of stopping, he continued the entire demonstration while "Let It Go" played in the background. The students were trying so hard not to laugh that they actually paid more attention than ever. Now he jokes that Disney soundtracks are his secret coaching weapon!

                    While teaching a bo staff routine, Amanda was performing a particularly impressive spinning sequence when she got a little too enthusiastic and accidentally knocked over the entire rack of training weapons. As wooden swords and nunchucks clattered to the floor, she struck a perfect ending pose and announced, "And that's why we always practice spatial awareness!" The students still call it the "Amanda Avalanche" and it's become a running joke about staying aware of your surroundings.

                    During a particularly grueling conditioning workout, David was motivating the class by doing every exercise alongside them. When it came time for burpees, he was counting out loud and got so focused on encouraging everyone that he lost count and kept going well past the set. Students started laughing as he hit 50+ burpees while still shouting "Just 10 more!" Now whenever someone complains about the workout being too hard, the class chants "Just 10 more!" in David's honor.

                    Maria was teaching a serious lesson about focus and concentration when a student's stomach growled so loudly it echoed through the entire dojo. Without breaking character, Maria immediately incorporated it into the lesson: "And that, class, is what we call a 'tactical distraction.' Your opponent's hunger can be your advantage!" She then spent the next 10 minutes teaching how to use unexpected sounds as timing cues for attacks. The students were amazed at how she turned an embarrassing moment into an actual learning opportunity.
