                    Bill started training Brazilian Jiu Jitsu in Southern California in 1995. He has trained with some of the greatest BJJ fighters and coaches, including Rigan Machado and his brothers, Bob Bass, Pedro Carvalho, Betiiss Mansouri and Rodrigo Teixiera. Bill continues to learn so his students are aware of new developments in BJJ, bringing in techniques from wrestling and other sports. Bill is aware that what works well for him might not be the best for every student, so he presents a variety of approaches and options for each technique. Students develop their own game or style, and Bill’s coaching style is flexible to accommodate each student’s strengths and limitations.

                         Jeff has trained in martial arts for most of his life, earning black belts or higher in 8 styles—3 of them Filipino. His early exposure to Filipino Martial Arts while living in the Philippines, due to his father’s Air Force posting, shaped his unique perspective on martial arts and life. Jeff sees himself more as a guide than a leader, believing that a martial art should reflect the student, not the instructor. In class, he prefers to be called Jeff or Coach.

                     Erika is a mental health provider by trade, but she's always struggled with meditation and mindfulness despite knowing how beneficial they are. Every time she’s tried, her mind drifts to her to-do list. But when she began training in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ), something clicked. Rolling in a safe, supportive environment became one of the few spaces where she could truly stay present and in tune with both her mind and body. For Erika, BJJ isn’t just a great physical workout, it’s also a powerful mindfulness practice that keeps her mentally grounded.
